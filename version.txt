Build 4
	* Fixed a similar problem with publishing an rtp mediaCaster where switching to the live stream twice would cause the stored playlist to be overwritten

Build 3
	* Fixed problem in ModuleLoopUntilLive where unpublishing an rtp mediaCaster would cause the stream to switch to the playlist twice, causing an NPE on the second switch
	
Build 2
	* Added the following properties to StreamPublisher to control the streams
		* `streamPublisherTimeInMilliSeconds` - if set then the start and duration times are in milliseconds instead of seconds. Default false (seconds)
		* `streamPublisherStartLiveOnPreviousKeyFrame` - if set, when switching to a live source, use teh most recent key frame as the start instead of waiting for the next one. Default false
		* `streamPublisherStartOnPreviousBufferTime` - how far to look back in teh packet list for the previous key frame. default 4100 (milliseconds)
		* `streamPublisherTimeOffsetBetweenItems` - specifies the millisecond gap between items (is currently overridden by an automatic check that use the larger of audio or video gap)
		* `streamPublisherUpdateMetadataOnNewItem` - if set, the onMetadata packet `title` field will be updated withe the name of the new item when a switch occurs. Default true (enabled)
