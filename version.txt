Build 6
	* Added HttpProvider to load and unload schedules. This can be used in place of the flash app
	
Build 5
	* Added the following properties to check if the live stream is ready before switching to live
		* `loopUntilLiveWaitForLiveTimeout` - How long to wait for the stream to be ready. default 10000ms
		* `loopUntilLiveWaitForLiveAudio` - wait for the live stream to have at least one audio packet available. default: true (disable for video only)
		* `loopUntilLiveWaitForLiveVideo` - wait for the live stream to have at least one video packet available. default: true (disable for audio only)
	* If both are set to true then the a further check is made to make sure the audio is within 50ms of the latest video key frame
	* Changed default for `streamPublisherStartLiveOnPreviousKeyFrame` to true

Build 4
	* Fixed a similar problem with publishing an rtp mediaCaster where switching to the live stream twice would cause the stored playlist to be overwritten

Build 3
	* Fixed problem in ModuleLoopUntilLive where unpublishing an rtp mediaCaster would cause the stream to switch to the playlist twice, causing an NPE on the second switch
	
Build 2
	* Added the following properties to StreamPublisher to control the streams
		* `streamPublisherTimeInMilliSeconds` - if set then the start and duration times are in milliseconds instead of seconds. Default false (seconds)
		* `streamPublisherStartLiveOnPreviousKeyFrame` - if set, when switching to a live source, use the most recent key frame as the start instead of waiting for the next one. Default false
		* `streamPublisherStartOnPreviousBufferTime` - how far to look back in the packet list for the previous key frame. default 4100 (milliseconds)
		* `streamPublisherTimeOffsetBetweenItems` - specifies the millisecond gap between items (is currently overridden by an automatic check that use the larger of audio or video gap)
		* `streamPublisherUpdateMetadataOnNewItem` - if set, the onMetadata packet `title` field will be updated with the name of the new item when a switch occurs. Default true (enabled)

Build 1
	* Initial commit
